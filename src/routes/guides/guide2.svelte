  <h2>Guide 2</h2>
  <p>There are two basic concepts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each page of your app is a Svelte component</li>
    <li>
      You create pages by adding files to the src/routes directory of your
      project. These will be server-rendered so that a user's first visit to
      your app is as fast as possible, then a client-side app takes over
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Try editing the files to get a feel for how everything works you may not
    need to bother reading the rest of this guide!
